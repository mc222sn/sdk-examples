# Kryptokrona Java SDK Examples
Example code for usage of Kryptokrona Java SDK. This is a submodule to the Kryptokrona SDK repo.

## Usage

To to start open up an example (e.g. "quick-start") in IntelliJ and it will automatically install all necessary dependencies.

Then use Gradle to build:

- `./gradlew build`

Then right click on the file inside `src/main/java/org/kryptokrona/sdkexample/Main.java` and run. 

NOTE: all examples should have the same structure for simplicity.
